> **If you’re in crisis right now:** Call or text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to the nearest emergency room. Support is free, confidential, and available 24/7.

## Key takeaways
- Depression and anxiety are common and treatable. Screening helps catch them early. [1–3]
- Effective care often includes **talk therapy (like CBT)**, **medication**, or **both**, matched to symptom severity and patient preference. [1,4]
- If you’re worried about safety (yours or a loved one’s), reach out immediately to emergency services or **988**. [5–7]

## What these conditions are
**Depression** affects mood, energy, sleep, appetite, and concentration. It’s more than “feeling down.”  
**Anxiety disorders** involve persistent, excessive worry or fear that interferes with daily life.

These conditions are common worldwide and can impact physical health if untreated. The good news: there are several proven options to help most people feel better. [2,3]

## Common signs
- Ongoing low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, sleep changes, appetite changes, difficulty concentrating, feelings of guilt or worthlessness (depression).
- Excessive worry that’s hard to control, restlessness, muscle tension, irritability, poor sleep, panic attacks (anxiety).
- Thoughts of self‑harm or suicide need same‑day attention. Call **988** or emergency services. [5–7]

## Screening and first steps
Primary care and mental health clinicians use brief questionnaires and focused interviews to screen for depression and anxiety. National task force guidance supports **routine screening for depression in adults** and **screening for anxiety in adults under 65** when systems are in place to ensure follow‑up. [3,8,9]

## What treatment usually looks like
Your plan should match **symptom severity**, **your preferences**, and **any other health conditions**.

- **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and related approaches help many people reduce symptoms and prevent relapse. [1,4]
- **Medication:** Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs) can reduce depression and several anxiety disorders. Medication choice considers symptoms, side effects, interactions, and goals. [1,4]
- **Combined care:** For moderate to severe depression, combining **therapy + medication** can be more effective than either alone. [1,4]
- **Follow‑up and relapse prevention:** Good care includes check‑ins to adjust the plan, plus skills for maintaining gains. [1,4]

## How families can help
- Encourage evaluation and **stick with treatment long enough** to see results.
- Offer practical support: rides, reminders, help with daily tasks during tough weeks.
- If safety is a concern, act now: call **988** or emergency services and stay with the person until help is connected. [5–7]

## When to seek urgent help
- You or a loved one have **active thoughts of self‑harm**, plans, or intent.
- Sudden, severe worsening of mood or anxiety.
- New confusion or concerning behavior.
